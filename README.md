# ACNHGenetics
A program to help understand the underlying rules of flower genetics in Animal Crossing New Horizons.

This Project is being created with test driven development.
This is being built as a portfolio piece as well as a project for fun.

Animal Crossing New Horizons has a system where you can breed flowers together in order to get hybrid flowers. There is a google drive document that lists the genotype and phenotype for each flower (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11pRCX8G0xGizSYWgVhoUSu7pE-MV7AOprBcgSY1whB4/edit#gid=312123918). This will be my input data.

The program creates a system that will let me, through a series of trial and error, determine what rules govern Animal Crossing's flower genetics.
